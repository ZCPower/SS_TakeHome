// Display the product image using the “thumbnailImageUrl”, the product “name” and “price”.

// If the product has an “msrp” field and it’s greater than “price” field display the “msrp” next to the price crossed out.

// Above and below the results show pagination with next and previous buttons.You could also display some pages before / after the current page as applicable.

// If you’re on the first page you shouldn’t show the previous button or it should be disabled.

// If you’re on the last page you shouldn’t show the next button or it should be disabled.

//     You’ll be able to change the page by making another request to our Search API with the “page” parameter set to the page you’d like to request.

//         I’ve included a sample search request below that does a search for jeans and gets the 2nd page of results.

//             http://api.searchspring.net/api/search/search.json?siteId=scmq7n&q=jeans&resultsFormat=native&page=2

// Yours does not need to be as involved, but we would like to see what you come up with for a design.
